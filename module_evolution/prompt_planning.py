base = """# Overview
You are an expert machine learning researcher testing various LLM agents. Your objective is to design planning modules such as prompts within these agents to solve complex tasks. The agents have four modules including planning (decomposing a large task into sub-tasks), reasoning (addressing a sub-task), tool use (selecting appropriate external tools for task solving) and memory (read and write experience, observations).
Your aim is to design an agent with optimal planning module performing well on ALFworld (sequential decision making tasks with steps including finding hidden objects, moving objects and manipulating objects with other objects ).

# Task Overview:
ALFworld is a suite of text-based environments that challenge an agent to solve multi-step tasks in a variety of interactive environments. It includes 6 types of tasks in which an agent needs to achieve a high-level goal (e.g. examine paper under desklamp) by navigating and interacting with a simulated household via text actions (e.g. go to coffeetable 1, take paper 2, use desklamp 1).
To solve this task, you need to first decompose the task using the planning module. Reasoning and memory modules are then used to solve each subtask.

# A task planning trajectory from Alfworld:
Task description: You are in the middle of a room. Looking quickly around you, you see a cabinet 13, a cabinet 12, a cabinet 11, a cabinet 10, a cabinet 9, a cabinet 8, a cabinet 7, a cabinet 6, a cabinet 5, a cabinet 4, a cabinet 3, a cabinet 2, a cabinet 1, a coffeemachine 1, a countertop 1, a diningtable 1, a drawer 1, a fridge 1, a garbagecan 1, a microwave 1, a shelf 3, a shelf 2, a shelf 1, a sinkbasin 1, a stoveburner 4, a stoveburner 3, a stoveburner 2, a stoveburner 1, and a toaster 1.     \nYour task is to: put a clean lettuce in diningtable.

# Discovered architecture archive
Here is the archive of the discovered planning module architectures:

[ARCHIVE]

The performance represents the completion rate of the task.

# Output Instruction and Example:
The first key should be ("thought"), and it should capture your thought process for designing the next function. In the "thought" section, first reason about what should be the next interesting agent to try, then describe your planning module.
The second key ("name") corresponds to the name of your next agent architecture.
Finally, the last key ("code") corresponds to the planning module in Python code that you would like to try. You must write a COMPLETE CODE in "code": Your code will be part of the entire project, so please implement complete, reliable, reusable code snippets.

Here is an example of the output format for the next agent architecture:

[Planning_example]

You must strictly follow the exact input/output interface used above. Also, it could be helpful to set the LLM's role and temperature to further control the LLM's response. DON'T try to use some function that doesn't exist.

# Your task
You are deeply familiar with prompting techniques and the agent works from the literature. Your goal is to maximize the specified performance metrics on the given task by proposing interestingly new planning module including prompts.
Observe the discovered planning modules carefully and think about what insights, lessons, or stepping stones can be learned from them.
THINK OUTSIDE THE BOX.
