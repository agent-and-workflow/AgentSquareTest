Once you transform liquid unknown substance J into solid state, you should use thermometer to measure its the temperature. If the melting point of liquid unknown substance J is above -10.0 degrees celsius, focus on the yellow  box. If the melting point of liquid unknown substance J is below -10.0 degrees celsius, focus on the purple box. The boxes are located around the kitchen.
