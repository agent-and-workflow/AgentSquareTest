2024-09-04 11:44:43 | GOAL | tasks.scienceworld | [1mExample 0 | Goal: task_name: boil, var: 5, Your task is to boil ice to liquid. You should get ice in the kitchen and boil it in the foundry. The objects you can use are metal pot, thermometer, freezer, blast furnace, stove and glass jar. You should pick up a thermometer for temperature measurement. Take actions that will cause it to change its state of matter.  You need to increase the ice's temperature and monitor the temperature closely. Once the ice's state of matter changed, examine the changed state of ice. For compounds without a boiling point, combusting the substance is also acceptable.
