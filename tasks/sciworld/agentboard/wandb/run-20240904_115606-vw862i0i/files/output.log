The objects you can use are thermometer, fridge, metal pot, stove. You should pick up a temperature in the kitchen for temperature measurement. Finally, after you melt the gallium, you should use thermometer to measure the temperature of it. If the melting point of gallium is above 50.0 degrees celsius, focus on the orange box. If the melting point of gallium is below 50.0 degrees celsius, focus on the yellow box. The boxes are located around the kitchen.

You should get orange juice and boil it in the kitchen. The objects you can use are a metal pot, a thermometer, a fridge, cups, and a stove in the kitchen. You should pick up a thermometer for temperature measurement.  Take actions that will cause it to change its state of matter.  You need to increase the orange juice's temperature and monitor the temperature until its is changed. Once the orange juice boiled, examine the changed state of orange juice. For compounds without a boiling point, combusting the substance is also acceptable.
