2024-08-31 13:32:53 | GOAL | tasks.scienceworld | [1mExample 59 | Goal: task_name: measure-melting-point-known-substance, var: 0, Your task is to measure the melting point of chocolate in the kitchen. The objects you can use are thermometer, fridge, metal pot, stove in the kitchen. You should pick up a thermometer for temperature measurement. Once the chocolate is melted, you should use thermometer to measure its temperature. If the melting point of chocolate is above -10.0 degrees celsius, focus on the blue box. If the melting point of chocolate is below -10.0 degrees celsius, focus on the orange box. The boxes are located around the kitchen.
