The objects you can use are thermometer, metal pot, stove in the kitchen. You should pick up a temperature in the kitchen for temperature measurement. You should monitor the temperature and examine the substance during the heating process. Once you melt the solid unknown substance H (transforming into liquid substance h), you should use thermometer to measure its the temperature. If the melting point of solid unknown substance H is above 150.0 degrees celsius, focus on the green box. If the melting point of unknown substance H is below 150.0 degrees celsius, focus on the blue box. The boxes are located around the kitchen.

The objects you can use are metal pot, thermometer, freezer, blast furnace, stove and glass jar. You should pick up a thermometer for temperature measurement. Take actions that will cause it to change its state of matter.  You need to increase the ice's temperature and monitor the temperature closely. Once the ice's state of matter changed, examine the changed state of ice. For compounds without a boiling point, combusting the substance is also acceptable.
